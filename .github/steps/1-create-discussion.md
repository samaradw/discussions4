# 📋 Step 1: Create a Discussion

Discussions are a great way to share updates, ask questions, or document decisions with your team. In this step, you'll create a GitHub Discussion to serve as the foundation for practicing pinning.

## ✨ Why this matters
Creating a discussion gives your team a shared space to communicate asynchronously and transparently. Pinning starts with creating something worth highlighting.

## ✅ What to do
1. Go to the **Discussions** tab in your newly created repository.
2. Click **“New discussion.”**
3. Use this title: `Skill Practice: Pinning Discussions`
4. Choose a category like **General** (or whatever is available).
5. Add a short message, such as:
   > Practicing how to create and pin GitHub Discussions!

Once you've created the discussion, the bot will detect it and guide you to the next step!
