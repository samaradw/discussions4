## Step 1: Open a pull request

_Welcome to "Review pull requests"! :wave:_

Let's get started by opening a pull request.

**What is a pull request?**: Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people. This pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `main` branch.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request

1. Create a branch called `enable-discussions`.
2. Make a small change (like editing this README).
3. Push the branch to GitHub.
4. Open a pull request from `enable-discussions` to `main`.
