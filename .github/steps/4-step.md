## Step 4: Organize with categories

Time to clean things up! üóÉÔ∏è Let's use categories to group similar discussion threads together.

### Why it Matters

Proper categorization keeps Discussions easy to browse and reduces clutter. Just like GitHub Issues benefit from labels, Discussions benefit from clear categories. They‚Äôre critical for larger teams or public repositories.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Change a Discussion's category

1. Open the recently created Discussion.

2. In the right details area, find the **Categories** area and click the settings icon.

3. Change the category to `Ideas`.

4. With the category updated, give Mona a moment to check your work and share the next steps
