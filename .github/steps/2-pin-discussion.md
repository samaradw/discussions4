# 📌 Step 2: Pin a Discussion thread

Now that you’ve created a Discussion, it’s time to highlight it by pinning it to the top of your Discussions tab.

## ✨ Why this matters
Pinning helps ensure that high-value Discussions—like announcements or key decisions—stay visible to all contributors.

## ✅ What to do
1. Open your Discussion titled `Skill Practice: Pinning Discussions`.
2. Click the **three-dot menu (⋯)** in the top-right corner of the post.
3. Select **Pin**.

Once pinned, the bot will recognize your action and move you to the next step.
