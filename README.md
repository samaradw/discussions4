## Step 5: Organize with Categories

Time to clean things up!

### 🗂️ Activity

Option A:  
1. Go to a discussion you created.
2. Click **Edit**.
3. Change the category to something else (e.g. from “Q&A” to “Ideas”).

Option B (if admin):  
1. Go to **Settings > Discussions**.
2. Add a new category.

Either action will complete this step!
