## Step 1: Set up GitHub Discussions

Let’s get started by enabling GitHub Discussions.

### ⚙️ Activity: Enable Discussions

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of this repository.
2. Under **Features**, check the box for **Discussions**.
3. Create a branch named `enable-discussions`.
4. Make a small edit to this README and push the branch.
5. Open a pull request from `enable-discussions` to `main`.

Once you do this, GitHub Actions will automatically move you to Step 2. ✨
