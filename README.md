## Step 1: Set Up GitHub Discussions

To get started, you'll enable GitHub Discussions in your repository settings and open your first pull request.

### ⚙️ Task: Enable Discussions

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of this repository.
2. Under **Features**, check the box for ✅ **Discussions**.
3. Create a new branch named `enable-discussions`.
4. Make a small edit to this README (like adding an emoji! 🎉).
5. Push the branch.
6. Open a pull request from `enable-discussions` → `main`.

Once completed, GitHub Actions will automatically advance you to Step 2. 🎯

### 💡 Why This Matters

Enabling GitHub Discussions sets the foundation for team-wide or community-wide collaboration. It’s especially useful for:

- Collecting feedback before code is written
- Supporting Q&A from users or contributors
- Hosting brainstorming sessions within context of the repo

Setting this up now ensures you can create and use discussions for future steps in this tutorial.
